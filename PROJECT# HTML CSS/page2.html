        <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br>
        <p>Our mission since we started has stayed simple: introduce our customers to the estates we directly buy our great tasting coffee from, roast the beans with care, and make high quality coffee more accessible through our cafes and our website. The coffee we roast is the coffee we like to drink, and we hope you like it too. </p><br>
        <h4>At Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, we follow a simple set of beliefs.</h4><br>
        <h3>Transparency is much more than just where we get our beans from.</h3><br>
        <p>The first thing we did when we started our company was to highlight our award winning farms. This idea of transparency organically evolved to the way we worked in other areas too - our baristas are always present to discuss brewing tips, our customer service team are there to walk you through your coffee questions, and our roasting team to show you how they work.</p><br>
        <h3>A culture of constant learning is the key to always pushing coffee forward.</h3><br>
        <p>We are consistently researching, testing and implementing best practices throughout our business to raise the bar. Making refractometers essential for our cafe brewing, holding advanced sensory learnings for junior roasters, and experimenting with processing at the farm level are just some of the ways that our highly skilled team is constantly evolving the way Indian coffee is treated, experienced or communicated about.</p><br>
        <h3>Sourcing the best coffee beans does not guarantee good coffee.</h3><br>
        <p>Although we have a dedicated sourcing team for green beans and have invested in establishing quality roasting parameters, we know that a lot more steps still have to fall into place to brew a good cup. This is why we have worked hard to create coffee training centres to impart leading procedures such as equipping baristas with assessing and reporting tools for precision brewing, and cupping every single batch that is roasted to ensure consistent quality</p><br>
